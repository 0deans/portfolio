This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and experience as a Full-Stack Developer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

**Installation & Running:**

    git clone https://github.com/0deans/portfolio.git

    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
